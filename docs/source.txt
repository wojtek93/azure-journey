Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure.
It allows users to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications without managing
the underlying control plane.

AKS integrates with Azure services such as Azure Container Registry, Azure Monitor
and Azure Active Directory.
